jcal is a UNIX-cal-like tool to display calendar
based on jalali reperesnation of date.

Switches in brief:
-y 	Display a calendar for the current year.
-p	Display year based on Pahlavi epoch. 
-j 	Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from Farvardin 1).
-1 	Display single month output. (This is the default.)
-3	Display prev/current/next months output.
-V 	Display calendar version.

If you're having troubles, compiling the package with GNU's build system keep reading.

Unsafe way of compilation
=========================

There is a non-portable Makefile available in package tree ``Makefile.old''
If you had troubles, compiling your package with ./configure script, rename
Makefile.old to Makefile, then simply invoke make and then make install as root.
